 Step One: Creating Empty Lists
- I create five empty lists for:
  - Names
  - Last names
  - Car names
  - Car colors
  - Car years



 Step Two: Starting the Main Program
- I start an infinite loop



 Step Three: Displaying the Menu
- I display the 8-option menu



 Step Four: Getting User Selection
- I ask the user which option they want (1 to 8)



 Step Five: If User Chooses Options 1-5
- I get the relevant information from the user
- I add the information to the appropriate list



 Step Six: If User Chooses Option 6 (Display Lists)
- I check all five lists:
  - If the list was not empty, I show its content
  - If the list was empty, I show the message "The list is empty!"



 Step Seven: If User Chooses Option 7 (Delete)
- I ask the user which list they want to delete from
- I check the selected list:
  - If the list was empty, I show a message
  - If it was not empty, I get the item to delete and delete it


 Step Eight: If User Chooses Option 8 (Exit)
- I show the "Goodbye" message
- I end the program



 Step Nine: Program Repetition
- After each operation, I return to the beginning of the program
- This process continues until the user chooses option 8
